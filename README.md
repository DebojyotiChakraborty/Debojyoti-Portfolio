# My Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is built using the [Magic UI Portfolio Template](https://magicui.design/docs/templates/portfolio) as a starting point.  It has been heavily modified and customized from the original template to fit my specific needs and style.

Magic UI provides a great foundation with pre-built components and templates, saving significant development time.  This project leverages the template's structure and some of its components, but includes substantial changes and additions throughout the site.
